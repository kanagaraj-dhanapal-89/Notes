# Important differences between Python 2.x and Python 3.x with examples
  -- Division operator
  -- print function
  -- Unicode
  -- xrange
  -- Error Handling
  -- _future_ module


# Division operator
  print 7 / 5

  print -7 / 5	
  ''' 
  Output in Python 2.x 
  1 
  -2 
  Output in Python 3.x : 
  1.4 
  -1.4

  '''
  
# print statement
  
  print 'Hello, Geeks'      # Python 3.x doesn't support  
  
  print('Hope You like these facts')

# Unicode:
  In Python 2, implicit str type is ASCII. But in Python 3.x implicit str type is Unicode.
  
# xrange:
  ==> 2.x 
    -- range(3) Returns: [0,1,2]
    -- xrange(3) is an itrator, will return the number when its needed
    
  ==> 3.x:
    -- there is no xrange
    -- xrange in 2.x is replaced in 3.x
    
# Error handling:
  In python 3.x, ‘as’ keyword is required.
    
 
# _future_ module:
  If we are planning to have Python 3.x support in our 2.x code, we can use _future_ imports in our code.
